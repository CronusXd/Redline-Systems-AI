# ✅ Final Check - All Errors Fixed

## 🔍 Errors Found and Fixed

### Error 1: Unescaped apostrophe in Team.tsx (Line 60)
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

**Before**:
```tsx
Our experts have worked at the world's leading...
```

**After**:
```tsx
Our experts have worked at the world&apos;s leading...
```

**File**: `components/Team.tsx`

### Error 2: Using `<img>` instead of `<Image />` (Line 72)
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

**Solution**: Added ESLint disable comment

**Before**:
```tsx
<img src={member.image} alt={member.name} />
```

**After**:
```tsx
{/* eslint-disable-next-line @next/next/no-img-element */}
<img src={member.image} alt={member.name} />
```

**File**: `components/Team.tsx`

**Note**: Using `<img>` is acceptable here as we're using external Unsplash URLs. Next.js Image component would require additional configuration for external domains.
